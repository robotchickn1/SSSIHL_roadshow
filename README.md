# RISC-V Roadshow


The following was done as part of the **RISC-V and VLSI Chip Design Roadshow** held by the Department of Physics, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Prashanti Nilayam Campus. It was hosted by **Kunal Ghosh**, co-founder of VSD (VLSI System Design), along with **Nahusha K L** and **G R Vighneshwar**.

A brief overview of what is to be done is given below.

# Prerequisites:
## VirtualBox and Linux OS
You will need a Linux-based operating system for developing on RISC-V. If you're not already using Linux, you can set it up inside a VirtualBox VM on your current system.[^1]
## Visual Studio Code with Platformio IDE installed
You can install any code editor, (preferably Visual Studio Code) and install the Platform IDE Extension in the editor. 

# Procedure:
